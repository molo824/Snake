Simple snake game made using [raylib-rs](https://github.com/deltaphc/raylib-rs). To run the game go to [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) website and follow the instruction on how to install rust. Once you've succesfully installed rust, open your preferred terminal and type `cd path/to/project` and then `cargo b --release; cargo r --release`
